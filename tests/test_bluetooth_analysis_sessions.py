"""HTTP-level tests for the Bluetooth analysis-session endpoints added in
`brainflow_service/analysis.py` -- `/headset-fit/sessions/{id}/analyze-window`
These are the Bluetooth counterpart of
`BrainFlowSession`'s per-session smoothing, already exercised for a direct
BrainFlow connection by `test_brainflow_pipeline.py`'s synthetic-board
tests: the point of this file is to show a Bluetooth connection now gets
the exact same kind of stateful, smoothed scores that a BrainFlow session's
stream does, instead of the single-window scores the old stateless
`/analyze-window` endpoint was limited to.

No `pytest.importorskip("brainflow")` guard is needed -- `analyze_window`
computes focus/relax scores from band powers via `dsp.py`'s numpy FFT
fallback when BrainFlow's own PSD/classifier calls aren't available, so
these tests run the same way either way.
